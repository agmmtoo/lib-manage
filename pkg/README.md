# `/pkg`

Contains code we wish to share with other repositories and projects.
As opposed to others, this directory will be visible and importable from other repos.

# Business Logic Notes

- we have no logic as library members, user can to purchase libraries' membership
- although books is separate table, they can be redundant. It's library's responsibility to manage them
